# Second training session on open science

Versioning, collaborating and documenting in open formats are of crucial importance for an open reproducible science. 


## Goals 
 - introduce basic versioning with git
 - wiki edition in Markdown format
 - strengthen your knowledge of CoBra as a whole

More precisely, we will collaboratively create a wiki containing :
  - a short description of each CoBra PhD topic (250-500 words max)
  - brief definitions of key concepts / notions involved in CoBra
  - brief presentation of main research methodologies employed in CoBra PhDs.
  - some key references

## Todo before the session

To finish, you only need to do two things before we start tomorrow: 
  - Create GitHub account if you do not have one and follow me (https://github.com/prevotlaurent) so I can easily invite you on our "project"
  - Prepare a short description of your PhD topic (250-500 words). If no time to do so, the actual official description of the project can do.  

## Comments

Some of you are very familiar with git and GitHub / wikis and markdown (probably more than me actually!). For those, I would ask whether you can provide help to the other ones that will probably need some time and help to figure out what is going on.


Git might not be the most easy way to collaboratively edit a document. The idea behind the choice of this activity is that wikis tend to include a lot of (text) files, much like many collaborative activities (scripting / coding/ ... ) and I hope it can be a good way to understand git at the same time.
